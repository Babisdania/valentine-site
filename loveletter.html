        <p>
           You are my unexpected happiness, Thangoo. I am so blessed to have you in my life. 
            I’ve been really missing you these past few days… I miss your presence so much.  
            From the moment you came into my life, everything became more beautiful.
            Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your love gives me strength
            I never knew I had.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every memory with you is my favorite memory.
            Every laugh we share is my favorite sound.
            Every second with you is my favorite moment.
        </p>

        <p>
            I promise to stand by your side,
            support your dreams,
            protect your heart,
            and love you endlessly.
        </p>

        <p>
            You are not just my Valentine…
            You are my forever thangamey. 💍❤️
